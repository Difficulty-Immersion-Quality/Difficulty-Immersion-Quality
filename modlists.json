    "description": "DIQ is an obsessively curated, patched, and polished mod list both inspired by classic CRPGs and reasonably faithful to 5th Edition D&D. The primary intention is to move BG3 away from being a theme park ride and introduce more gameplay elements one would expect of an immersive sim, elevating the already solid narrative driven RPG bones of the vanilla game.\n\nDIQ has been built up over more than 2 years with thousands of hours spent on development and a firm intent to capture a specific vision, to make it ever more worthy of its name. Despite the core vision, DIQ also boasts a large amount of customisation options and even optional adult mods; no stone is left unturned in the pursuit of offering the most robust and attractive end user experience, so long as it doesn't conflict with the core vision of DIQ itself.",
