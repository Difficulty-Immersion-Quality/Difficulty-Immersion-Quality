Listed below is information about BaldursGoonsack's Difficulty, Immersion, Quality modlist.

[  [Changelog](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/baldursgate3/collections/pns4qv/changelog) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) | [Load Order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/difficulty-immersion-quality) ]

Available on two platforms, Difficulty, Immersion, Quality can be played and installed via [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1) or [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/) and [Mod Organizer 2](https://github.com/Modorganizer2/modorganizer/releases).

Difficulty, Immersion, Quality (DIQ) is _probably_ the most polished publicly available large scale mod list for Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3), it has been consistently curated over the course of 2+ years in an attempt to capture a specific vision that's still being worked towards.\
\
My hope with DIQ is to try and move BG3 away from being a theme park ride and introduce more gameplay elements one would expect of an immersive sim, elevating the already solid RPG bones underneath.

DIQ is a list focused on bringing a greater challenge for players with a background in CRPGs, tabletop, or even those unfamiliar who just like a punch in the nuts every now and then.

Difficulty isn't _only_ increased through the buffing of numbers, it's enhanced by the addition of systematic changes that truly change the game and the way you play it. From adjusting [help](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10340) and [healing potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/15391), to [having NPCs with improved class functionality](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/15535), or adding a whole new system for [injuries, exhaustion and madness](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14863) there should be plenty to make your playthrough challenging and satisfying.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Difficulty-Immersion-Quality/Difficulty-Immersion-Quality/refs/heads/main/Placeholder%20Art/DIQ%20Immersion%20Banner.png)

It's all about the little things adding up when it comes to capturing a more immersive experience. From something small like [taking off your shoes before bed](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14726), to something creative like [Gale's Netherese affliction being more mechanically involved](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14442) or something that really shouldn't need to be a mod, like [giving Minthara her own space](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14148).

While I don't adhere to rules as written (RAW) religiously, D&D 5th Edition (2014) serves as a solid foundation for balance, and I try not to have things stray too far from it, even if it's Larian who strayed from the path in their design. You won't see a lot of 2024 stuff here as I don't like a whole lot of the changes, some are great, most are just power-creep for power-creep sake.

The homebrew material that does exist in DIQ shouldn't feel too far detached from D&D 5th Edition (2014), Forgotten Realms or vanilla Baldur's Gate 3.

I am a mod author, and many of the authors who's mods are in the collection are also present and active within the [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks); such as [osirisofinternet](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/6682532) (Di Immortalis), [actualsailorcat](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/78518828), [Cahooots](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/50497581), [wtfbengt](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/16726234), [TheWailingBard](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/60264956), [sumradagnoth8](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/186661377), [NellsRelo](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/244952) and [Lumaterian](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/users/193037348).

Players report issues and they're continually addressed to offer the best experience possible, all players with feedback and reports are responded to, addressed and helped as is reasonable.

Basically every mod within the collection is unpacked and screened for compatibility and other issues before being added, files and entries are constantly compared ensuring DIQ does not suffer from near as many compatibility issues other mod lists may have.

:warning: If you want to mod a game you must be willing to **read**, **learn** and **commit** some time to it. Even when using a collection in its default state you should be attempting to understand the **what**, **why** and **how**. <br>
<br>
:question: If you have a general question it's likely already answered on this page.
<br>
<br>
:trophy: You can earn achievements with this collection installed thanks to [Script Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/bg3se)!
<br>
<br>
:bulb: A decent portion of the collection's size is found in the optional mods.
<br>
<br>
:writing_hand: Most mods are not translated to languages other than English, some comprehension of English is basically required.

 :x: Do not seek support when using the collection outside of my [Discord](https://discord.gg/baldursgoonsacks) or this collection page, do not report bugs to authors when using the collection. The folks spending their free time helping in the [Larian Studios Discord](https://discord.gg/larianstudios) will just direct you back to me, and authors don't need reports of false positives that waste their time :x:

  :white_check_mark: Report issues to me, I will diagnose things and filter more accurate information to relevant authors. :white_check_mark:

:boom: You cannot use other curator's collections alongside this one, stuff will break! :boom:

:brain: Only big brained, longtime mod users, or very patient folk should attempt to customise this list! :brain:

:exclamation: I do not recommend playing **_Honour Mode_**, it's bad enough in vanilla where bugs still exist, pile hundreds of mods on top and you're really gambling. BG3 is a long game, previous saves are a useful commodity; **instead** play the game on **_Custom Mode_**, turn **_Honour Ruleset_** on and click **_Restore Defaults_** to toggle Tactician difficulty and other custom settings of mine. :exclamation:

:exclamation: New games only, don't install this collection for an existing playthrough, especially an existing modded playthrough. :exclamation:
